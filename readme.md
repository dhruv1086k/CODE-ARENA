# Code Arena

## Purpose

Code Arena is a **personal productivity and coding journey tracker** built to measure **consistency, not perfection**.

The goal of this platform is to help me:
- Track how regularly I study and code
- Visualize daily effort through activity data
- Build a sustainable learning habit with minimal friction

This is **not**:
- A social platform  
- A note-taking app  
- A project showcase  

It is a **private system for self-accountability and growth**.

## Activity Rules

Activity is **automatically generated by the system**.

### Activity is created when:
- A **study session is completed**
- A **todo is marked as completed**

### Activity is NOT created when:
- A timer is started
- A todo is created
- An event is added

Activity is aggregated **per day** and used for:
- Activity heatmap
- Streak tracking
- Monthly summaries

Daily activity records are **derived data** and are not directly editable.
